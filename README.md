# ESP32-CAM Web Server with OTA and WebSocket

This project provides a codebase for setting up a web server on the ESP32-CAM module with OTA (Over-The-Air) updates and WebSocket support. The ESP32-CAM board is a versatile development board with an integrated camera, making it suitable for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications involving image processing and web interactions.

## Features

1. **Web Server:** The ESP32-CAM acts as a web server, allowing users to access a web page with live streaming from the integrated camera and control various functionalities.

2. **OTA Updates:** Over-The-Air updates enable remote firmware updates without the need for physical access to the device. This simplifies the process of deploying code changes and new features.

3. **WebSocket Communication:** The ESP32-CAM establishes a WebSocket connection, enabling real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients, facilitating instant updates and interactive features.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following hardware and software:

- ESP32-CAM development board
- USB-UART adapter for programming and debugging (if not integrated)
- Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO) with ESP32 board support installed
- Required libraries (list the required libraries with links to their repositories)

Additionally, this project utilizes SPIFFS (SPI Flash File System) to store files such as HTML, CSS, and other assets for the web server. If you haven't set up SPIFFS yet, follow the steps in the tutorial [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-vs-code-platformio-spiffs/) to learn how to configure and upload files to the ESP32-CAM's Filesystem.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP archive and extract it.

2. Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

3. Install any required libraries by going to **"Sketch" → "Include Library" → "Manage Libraries"** and then searching for the library name.

4. Connect your ESP32-CAM board to your computer using the USB-UART adapter.

5. Select the appropriate board and port from the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

6. Upload the code to your ESP32-CAM board, including the SPIFFS data.

## Uploading Files to SPIFFS

To upload the required files (such as HTML, CSS, and other assets) to SPIFFS, follow the steps outlined in the tutorial [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-vs-code-platformio-spiffs/). These files are essential for the web server to function correctly and provide the web interface.

## Usage

1. After the code is successfully uploaded, open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO to see the ESP32-CAM's IP address.

2. Enter the provided IP address into your web browser to access the web interface.

3. The web page should display live streaming from the camera and provide controls for interacting with the ESP32-CAM's functionalities.

4. To perform OTA updates, go to the designated OTA update page (provide instructions and a link on the web interface).

5. For WebSocket communication, clients can connect to the WebSocket endpoint and start exchanging data with the server.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements. You can add new features, improve the user interface, or integrate additional sensors and actuators.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions, check the following:

- Verify that all connections are correct.
- Ensure you have installed the required libraries.
- Check for any error messages in the Serial Monitor.

If you're still facing problems, don't hesitate to seek help from the community or refer to the ESP32-CAM documentation.
